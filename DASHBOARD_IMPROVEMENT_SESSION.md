# Citebots Dashboard Improvement Session

## Project Overview

Working on an internal SEO/digital marketing tool that analyzes citations in LLM responses (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity). The dashboard is used to share client reports through `/dashboard/reports/[id]` with various tabs for different visualizations.

## Current State Assessment

### Architecture Overview

#### Frontend Stack
- **Framework**: Nuxt 3 with Vue 3 Composition API
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with dark mode support
- **State Management**: Composables and Pinia stores
- **Data Fetching**: Supabase client with RLS

#### Dashboard Architecture
- **Main Layout**: `layouts/dashboard.vue` - Two-sidebar design with SlimTopBar
  - Left Icon Bar: Collapsible navigation
  - Context Panel: Section-specific navigation (288px fixed width)
  - Main Content Area: Scrollable with max-width constraint

- **Report Viewer**: `pages/dashboard/reports/[id].vue`
  - URL-based tab routing with query parameter `?tab=`
  - Dynamic component loading based on active tab
  - Authentication and ownership checks
  - Loading/error states

### Data Architecture

#### Core Tables (from `current-data-model.md`)
1. **clients** - Client organizations
   - Ownership tracked by `created_by` OR `user_id` (legacy issue)
   - Keywords stored as arrays
   - AI enhancement fields available

2. **competitors** - Separate table linked by `client_id`
   - Not stored as JSON in clients table
   - Domain-based matching

3. **analysis_runs** - Batch analysis metadata
   - Status tracking
   - Platform selection (chatgpt/perplexity/both)
   - Progress indicators

4. **analysis_queries** - Individual query results
   - Rich metadata: intent, type, category, funnel stage
   - Brand/competitor mention tracking
   - Response analysis fields

5. **page_analyses** - Citation page analysis
   - JSONB fields for flexible metrics:
     - `technical_seo`
     - `content_quality`
     - `page_performance`
     - `domain_authority`
     - `on_page_seo`

### Current Dashboard Components

#### Main Dashboard Tabs (from SidebarContextPanel)
1. **Overview** - Primary metrics and query analysis
2. **Brand Performance** - Brand-specific metrics
3. **Query Analysis** - Query breakdown and patterns
4. **Technical SEO** - SEO metrics from page analyses
5. **Page Analytics** - Citation page performance
6. **Competitors** - Competitor comparison
7. **Raw Data** - Data export view

#### Key Visualization Components
- `QueryAnalysisComponent` - Main query analysis widget
- `CompetitorMentionRate` - Competitor mention comparisons
- `CompetitorCitationRate` - Citation rate analysis
- `QueryPerformanceTable` - Expandable performance table
- `BrandPerformanceDashboard` - Dedicated brand view
- Various gauge and chart components

### Design Patterns

1. **Component Organization**
   - Dashboard components in `/components/reports/`
   - Sub-components in `/components/reports/components/`
   - Utility components in `/components/reports/utils/`

2. **Data Flow**
   - Report data fetched in parent component ([id].vue)
   - Passed down as props to dashboard components
   - Computed properties for derived metrics

3. **Dark Mode**
   - Uses `useDarkMode()` composable
   - Tailwind dark: classes throughout
