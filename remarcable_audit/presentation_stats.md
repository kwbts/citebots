# Remarcable SEO Audit - Key Metrics & Findings
**Presentation Stats & Visuals**
**Date:** November 10, 2025

---

## 1. Organic Visibility 🟡

**TOTAL KEYWORDS TRACKING**
# 194

**140 NON-BRANDED (72%)** | **54 BRANDED (28%)**

### Position Distribution
- Keywords in Top 10: **12 (6%)**
- Positions 1-3: **2**
- Positions 4-10: **10**
- Positions 21-50: **29**
- Position 50+: **77**

**Context:** Brand presence exists, but category/solution terms are under-optimized. Most visibility sits beyond page 1, limiting discovery traffic.

---

## 2. Site Health 🟢

**TOTAL PAGES**
# 59
*Manageable size for optimization*

### Technical Issues
- Missing canonical tags: **58 of 59** 🚨 TEMPLATE FIX
- Thin pages (<300 words): **17**
- Broken links (4xx): **4** 🧹 CLEAN
- Redirects (3xx): **6**

**Context:** Solid foundation. Site is structurally sound, just needs metadata polish and content depth.

---

## 3. The CTR Crisis 🔴

**TOTAL IMPRESSIONS**
# 161,138
*In last 3-12 months*

**TOTAL CLICKS**
# 15

**AVERAGE CTR**
# 0.01%

**Context:** This is the core problem. You're getting seen but not clicked. 161K people see you in search results, only 15 click through.

---

## 4. Position 3.9 Getting ZERO Clicks 🔴

**QUERY:** "tool procurement for contractors"

**MONTHLY IMPRESSIONS**
# 88

**CURRENT CLICKS**
# 0

**EXPECTED CTR AT POSITION 3.9**
# 18-22%

**Expected clicks/month:** 15-20
**Actual clicks/month:** 0
**Lost opportunity:** 180-240 clicks/year

**Context:** You rank on page 1, position 3.9, but your title/meta description isn't compelling enough to earn clicks. Pure CTR optimization opportunity.

---

## 5. Page 2 Gold Mine 🟡

**QUERIES RANKING POSITIONS 11-20**
# 19

**COMBINED MONTHLY IMPRESSIONS**
# 2,859

**CURRENT CLICKS**
# 1

**Context:** You're on page 2 for your core keywords. Small optimizations to move these to positions 5-8 would 10x your traffic.

### Top Opportunities
1. "construction purchasing software" - 938 impressions, position 15.1
2. "construction material management software" - 557 impressions, position 10.1 (so close!)
3. "material management software for construction" - 433 impressions, position 15.8

---

## 6. The Electrical Contractor Invisibility Problem 🔴

**YOUR TARGET AUDIENCE SEARCHES**

### Combined Stats
- Total impressions: **5,529/month**
- Total clicks: **2**
- Average position: **77-92**

### Query Breakdown
| Query | Impressions | Position | Clicks |
|-------|-------------|----------|--------|
| electrical contractor | 2,289 | 88.6 | 2 |
| electrical contractor software | 1,624 | 77.9 | 0 |
| electrician software | 1,616 | 74.9 | 0 |

**Context:** Your core audience is searching but can't find you. This is a brand awareness crisis for your primary market.

---

## 7. The Generic Category Gap 🟡

**HIGH-VOLUME CATEGORY TERMS YOU'RE MISSING**

### Procurement Software Cluster
| Query | Impressions | Your Position | Clicks |
|-------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| procurement software | 3,284 | 64.3 | 0 |
| purchasing software | 3,701 | 66.1 | 0 |
| procurement management software | 2,088 | 60.6 | 0 |
| construction procurement software | 1,944 | 39.2 | 0 |

**TOTAL MISSED OPPORTUNITY**
# 11,017 impressions/month

**Context:** You rank well for specific terms ("material procurement software" - position 7.7) but invisible for broad category searches. Need pillar content to bridge this gap.

---

## 8. Core Web Vitals Status 🔴

**PAGES ANALYZED**
# 59

**PAGES PASSING CWV**
# 0 (0%)

### Average Scores by Section
| Section | Pages | Avg LCP | Status |
|---------|-------|---------|--------|
| Home page | 1 | 17.79s | ❌ FAIL |
| Solution pages | 7 | 13.12s | ❌ FAIL |
| Integration pages | 15 | 7.35s | ❌ FAIL |
| Resources | 20 | 10.58s | ❌ FAIL |

**Primary blocker:** LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) too slow
**Secondary issue:** TBT (Total Blocking Time) elevated
**Bright spot:** CLS (layout shift) is stable at 0.00

**Context:** Performance needs work, BUT this is ranked #16-20 in priorities because it doesn't solve your core problem (visibility). Fix CTR and rankings first.

---

## 9. Backlink Profile 🟡

**DOMAIN RATING**
# 31
*Modest authority, trending up*

### Link Distribution
- Referring Domains: **162**
- Total Backlinks: **572**
- Followed links: **409 (71.5%)**
- Nofollow links: **163 (28.5%)**

### Top Anchors (all branded)
1. "remarcable" - 55 domains, 230 links
2. "remarcable.com" - 38 domains, 69 links
3. Empty anchor - 19 domains, 44 links

**Context:** Good foundation, but heavily branded. Need topic/solution anchors to build category relevance beyond brand.

---

## 10. Competitor Keyword Gap 🟡

**NON-BRAND KEYWORDS WHERE COMPETITORS RANK TOP 30**
*(And Remarcable doesn't rank in Top 50)*

### By Theme
| Theme | Gap Keywords | What This Means |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|
| Materials management | 39 | Competitors own this territory |
| Integrations & ERPs | 12 | Strong presence for integration queries |
| Procurement & purchasing | 12 | Missing procurement workflow searches |
| Construction segment | 11 | Construction-specific terms uncaptured |

**TOTAL OPPORTUNITY KEYWORDS**
# 114

**Context:** Clear, mappable opportunities. Competitors consistently capture searches for your exact product capabilities.

---

## 11. Top Competitor Opportunities 🟡

**HIGH-VALUE GAPS**

### Material Management
- "material management software" - 800 vol, competitor pos 1
- "construction materials management software" - 60 vol, competitor pos 2
- "material management software for construction" - 100 vol, competitor pos 28

### Procurement
- "construction procurement software" - 300 vol, competitor pos 3
- "procurement software for construction" - 150 vol, competitor pos 4

### Integrations
- "procore marketplace" - 250 vol, competitor pos 31
- "quickbooks inventory management" - 150 vol, competitor pos 9

**Context:** These aren't aspirational - competitors are WINNING on these terms with solutions pages, integration hubs, and resources.

---

## 12. Internal Linking Imbalance 🟡

**AVERAGE INLINKS PER PAGE GROUP**

| Section | Avg Inlinks | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Solutions | 155.43 | ✅ Strong |
| Other (About, etc.) | 57.0 | ✅ Good |
| Resources | 9.0 | 🟡 Weak |
| Integrations | 5.8 | 🔴 Very weak |

**Context:** Solutions pages are well-linked, but Integrations (commercial pages) and Resources (support pages) are underlinked. This limits their ranking potential.

---

## 13. H1 Tag Chaos 🟡

**PAGES WITH MULTIPLE H1s**

### By Section
- Home: **1 of 1 (100%)**
- Solutions: **7 of 7 (100%)**
- Integrations: **15 of 15 (100%)**
- Resources: **20 of 20 (100%)**
- Other: **16 of 16 (100%)**

**TOTAL PAGES AFFECTED**
# 59 of 59 (100%)

**Context:** Template-level issue. Every page has multiple H1s, diluting topical focus. One template fix solves this sitewide.

---

## 14. Title Tag Problems 🟡

**PAGES WITH TITLE ISSUES**

### Too Short (Under 45 chars)
- Solutions: **5 pages**
- Other: **11 pages**
- **Total:** 16 pages

### Too Long (Over 60 chars)
- Resources: **13 pages**

**Context:** Short titles = missed keyword opportunities. Long titles = truncated in SERPs. Both hurt CTR and relevance.

---

## 15. Schema Markup 🟡

**STRUCTURED DATA IMPLEMENTED**
# 0

**Missing:**
- ❌ Organization schema
- ❌ WebSite schema
- ❌ Breadcrumb schema
- ❌ Article/BlogPosting schema
- ❌ FAQPage schema
- ❌ SoftwareApplication schema

**Context:** No structured data means missed SERP enhancements, no rich results, and reduced clarity for search engines.

---

- **Annual value:** 480-600 clicks/year

### ROI at $50 cost per lead (3% conversion):

- Value: $700-900/year
- **ROI:** 17% monthly return

**Context:** Fastest, easiest win available. Title tag rewrites for existing page 1 rankings.

---

## 17. Position 11-20 Opportunity 💰

**MEDIUM-TERM OPPORTUNITY (Week 2-4)**

### Action: Optimize 19 Queries from Page 2 → Page 1
- **Effort:** 16-20 hours
- **Cost:** ~$1,600-2,000
- **Expected gain:** +150-200 clicks/month

**Context:** You're SO CLOSE on these. Small content optimizations to push from position 15 → position 7.

---

## 18. Content Coverage vs. Performance Gap 📊

**DEEP CONTENT ≠ SEARCH PERFORMANCE**

| Topic Cluster | Pages | Depth | Impressions | Clicks | Avg Position |
|---------------|-------|-------|-------------|--------|--------------|
| Procurement Automation | 15 | Deep | 67,738 | 6 | 62.3 |
| Accounting Integration | 18 | Deep | 2,900 | 0 | 18.9 |
| Customer Stories | 7 | Deep | 160 | 0 | N/A |
| **AI Features** | **5** | **Shallow** | **600** | **0** | **12.3** |

**Context:** The AI cluster (5 pages) ranks BETTER than Procurement (15 pages). More content doesn't equal better rankings. You're writing product docs when you need search-optimized category content.

---

## 19. Funnel Content Imbalance 📊

**CONTENT DISTRIBUTION BY FUNNEL STAGE**

### Current State
- **Awareness:** 2 pages (4%)
- **Evaluation:** 8 pages (17%)
- **Decision:** 37 pages (79%)

### What Searchers Want (Based on GSC)
- **Awareness/Evaluation:** 85% of impressions
- **Decision:** 15% of impressions

**THE MISMATCH**
# 79% of content for 15% of searches

**Context:** You're creating content for people who've already decided (product features, integrations, case studies) while ignoring people discovering solutions. This is why case studies get 0 organic traffic.
