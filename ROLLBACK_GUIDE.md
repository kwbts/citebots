# Rollback Guide

This document outlines the procedures for rolling back changes made during the refactoring process if issues are encountered. It provides instructions for reverting to previous states at various stages of the project.

## General Rollback Principles

1. **Immediate Assessment**: When an issue is detected, immediately assess its severity and impact
2. **Communication**: Notify the team lead and affected stakeholders as per the communication plan
3. **Documentation**: Record all rollback actions in the REFACTOR_LOG.md file
4. **Verification**: After rollback, verify system functionality using the standard test suite
5. **Root Cause Analysis**: Conduct a post-rollback analysis to understand what went wrong
6. **Recovery Plan**: Develop a plan to re-attempt the refactoring with appropriate adjustments

## Rollback Types

### Type 1: Code-Level Rollback
For reverting changes to individual files or components.

### Type 2: Database Schema Rollback
For reverting database schema changes.

### Type 3: Full System Rollback
For reverting to a previous known-good state of the entire system.

### Type 4: Configuration Rollback
For reverting configuration changes.

## Rollback Procedures by Phase

### Phase 1: [Analysis & Planning]

This phase is primarily documentation and planning. No production code changes should occur.

**Rollback Procedure**:
1. Revert any documentation changes in the repository
2. Notify team that planning documents have been reverted
3. Reschedule planning sessions as needed

### Phase 2: [Core Refactoring - Part 1]

**Rollback Procedure**:

#### Code Rollback:
1. Identify the commit hash before the refactoring changes began: `[commit-hash]`
2. Execute the following git commands:
   ```bash
   git checkout [commit-hash]
   git checkout -b rollback-[YYYY-MM-DD]
   git push origin rollback-[YYYY-MM-DD]
   ```
3. Create a pull request to merge the rollback branch into the main branch
4. After review, merge the PR
5. Deploy the rolled back version

#### Database Rollback:
1. Execute the database rollback script:
   ```sql
   -- Place your SQL rollback statements here
   -- Example:
   ALTER TABLE [table_name] DROP COLUMN [column_name];
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS [new_table_name];
   ```
2. Verify database integrity using test scripts

---

### Phase 3: [Core Refactoring - Part 2]

**Rollback Procedure**:

#### Partial Rollback (Specific Component):
1. Identify the files related to the component: 
   - `/path/to/component/file1.ext`
   - `/path/to/component/file2.ext`
2. Execute the following git commands:
   ```bash
   git checkout [previous-commit-hash] -- /path/to/component/file1.ext /path/to/component/file2.ext
   git commit -m "Rollback: Revert changes to [component name]"
   git push origin [branch-name]
   ```
3. Deploy the specific component changes

#### API Changes Rollback:
1. Revert to the previous API version in the API gateway configuration
2. Deploy the API gateway changes
3. Notify all API consumers of the rollback

---

### Phase 4: [Testing & Validation]

**Rollback Procedure**:

If issues are detected during testing:

1. Do not proceed to production deployment
2. Document the specific test failures
3. Create targeted fixes for the issues
4. If fixes are not feasible in the short term, follow the Phase 2 or 3 rollback procedures as appropriate
5. Rerun the test suite after rollback to verify system integrity

---

### Phase 5: [Deployment & Monitoring]

**Rollback Procedure**:

#### Canary Deployment Rollback:
1. Immediately redirect traffic back to the previous version
2. Execute the following commands in your deployment system:
   ```bash
   # Example for Kubernetes
   kubectl rollout undo deployment/[deployment-name]
   
   # Example for a manual deployment
   cp -R /backup/[previous-version]/* /production/
   systemctl restart [service-name]
   ```
3. Verify system functionality using synthetic transactions
4. Notify users of the temporary service disruption

#### Full Production Rollback:
1. Activate the emergency rollback procedure:
   ```bash
   # Run the full rollback script
   ./scripts/emergency-rollback.sh [version-to-rollback-to]
   ```
2. Execute database rollback if necessary (see Database Rollback above)
3. Verify system functionality using the full test suite
4. Notify all stakeholders as per the incident response plan
5. Schedule a post-mortem analysis

## Rollback Decision Matrix

| UI Bug | High | < 1 hour | Code-Level | Project Manager |
| Functional Bug | Low | < 8 hours | Code-Level | Team Lead |
| Functional Bug | Medium | < 4 hours | Code-Level | Project Manager |
| Functional Bug | High | < 30 minutes | Full System | Project Manager & CTO |
| Data Corruption | Any | Immediate | Full System + DB | CTO |
| Performance Degradation | Low | < 24 hours | Code-Level | Team Lead |
| Performance Degradation | Medium | < 4 hours | Code-Level | Project Manager |
| Performance Degradation | High | < 1 hour | Full System | Project Manager & CTO |
| Security Vulnerability | Any | Immediate | Full System | CTO |

## Emergency Contacts

| Role | Name | Contact Information | Backup Contact |
|------|------|---------------------|---------------|
| Team Lead | [Name] | [Email] / [Phone] | [Backup Name] |
| Project Manager | [Name] | [Email] / [Phone] | [Backup Name] |
| CTO | [Name] | [Email] / [Phone] | [Backup Name] |

## System Restore Points

The following system restore points have been established for full system rollbacks:

| Restore Point ID | Date | Description | Verification Status |
|------------------|------|-------------|---------------------|
| RP-001 | [YYYY-MM-DD] | Pre-refactoring baseline | Verified |
| RP-002 | [YYYY-MM-DD] | After Phase 2 completion | Verified |
| RP-003 | [YYYY-MM-DD] | After Phase 3 completion | Verified |
| RP-004 | [YYYY-MM-DD] | Pre-production deployment | Verified |

## Post-Rollback Procedures

After completing any rollback:

1. **Documentation**:
   - Update the REFACTOR_LOG.md with details of the rollback
   - Document the root cause of the issue that necessitated the rollback
   - Update any relevant tickets or issues in the project management system

2. **Analysis**:
   - Conduct a team review of what went wrong
   - Identify improvements to testing procedures that could have caught the issue
   - Update the refactoring plan to address the identified issues

3. **Communication**:
   - Notify all stakeholders that the system has been restored
   - Provide an estimated timeline for re-attempting the refactoring (if applicable)
   - Share lessons learned with the broader team

4. **Verification**:
   - Run a full system health check
   - Verify that no data was lost during the rollback
   - Confirm that all integrations and dependencies are functioning correctly
