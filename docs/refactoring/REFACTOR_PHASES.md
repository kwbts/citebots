# Citebots Refactoring: Phased Approach

This document outlines the phased approach for refactoring the Citebots platform. The phases are designed to minimize risk while progressively improving the codebase's stability, maintainability, and performance.

## Guiding Principles

1. **Incremental Improvement**: Each phase should deliver concrete improvements while maintaining system stability
2. **Test-Driven Approach**: Changes should be verified with appropriate tests before and after implementation
3. **User Experience Priority**: Changes should maintain or improve the user experience
4. **Documentation First**: Each phase begins with documentation of current state and planned changes
5. **Risk Mitigation**: Higher-risk changes should follow lower-risk foundational improvements

## Phase Overview

| Phase | Focus | Timeline | Risk Level | Priority |
|-------|-------|----------|------------|----------|
| 1 | Foundation and Stabilization | 2-3 weeks | Low | High |
| 2 | Architecture Standardization | 3-4 weeks | Medium | High |
| 3 | Core System Improvements | 4-6 weeks | High | High |
| 4 | Performance Optimization | 2-3 weeks | Medium | Medium |
| 5 | Technical Debt Reduction | Ongoing | Low | Medium |
