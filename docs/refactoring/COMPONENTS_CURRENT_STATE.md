# Current State of Components for Refactoring

This document captures the current state of key components targeted for refactoring in the Citebots platform. It provides a baseline understanding of existing functionality, known issues, and architectural considerations.

## 1. Queue System

### Current Implementation

The queue system is designed to handle long-running analysis operations by distributing work across multiple edge function invocations. It consists of database tables, edge functions, and frontend components.

#### Database Structure
- `analysis_queue` table: Stores individual queue items
  - Fields: `id`, `analysis_run_id`, `query_id`, `status`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `processor_id`, `attempts`, `max_attempts`, `error`
- `analysis_runs` table: Tracks overall analysis runs
  - Fields: `id`, `client_id`, `status`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `created_by`, `total_queries`, `processed_queries`

#### Key Components
- **Edge Functions**:
  - `process-queue-worker`: Primary worker that processes queue items
  - `run-custom-analysis`: Creates analysis runs and queue items
- **Frontend**:
  - `QueueProgress.vue`: Displays progress information
  - `useQueueAnalysis.ts`: Composable for queue operations

#### Process Flow
1. Client requests analysis via `run-custom-analysis`
2. System creates an `analysis_run` record and multiple `analysis_queue` items
3. Queue workers are triggered to process items in batches
4. Workers claim batches via atomic database operations
5. Workers process items and update statuses
6. Frontend polls for updates and displays progress

### Known Issues

1. **Continuation Failures**:
   - Workers stop after processing ~47 items
   - Cold starts interrupt processing chains
   - No reliable continuation mechanism

2. **Error Handling Gaps**:
   - Inconsistent error recovery approaches
   - Some errors not properly captured or logged
   - No dead letter queue for persistent failures

3. **Resource Contention**:
   - Multiple concurrent workers compete for resources
   - No throttling or backoff strategy
   - External API rate limits not properly managed

4. **Monitoring Limitations**:
   - Limited visibility into processing status
   - No alerting for stalled processing
   - Insufficient logging for diagnostics

### Performance Characteristics

- **Processing Rate**: ~1-2 queries per second under ideal conditions
- **Timeout Frequency**: Approximately 5% of workers time out
- **Error Rate**: ~10% of items require retry due to external API issues
- **Scalability Limit**: Practically limited to ~100 queries per run

### Code Quality Assessment

- **Complexity**: High (8/10) - Complex async processing with many edge cases
- **Maintainability**: Low (3/10) - Limited documentation, inconsistent patterns
- **Test Coverage**: Minimal (1/10) - Few automated tests
- **Documentation**: Poor (2/10) - Limited inline comments, no architectural docs

## 2. Edge Function Architecture

### Current Implementation

Edge functions serve as the primary backend processing layer, handling everything from user authentication to complex analysis operations.

#### Structure
- Single `index.ts` file per function (Supabase limitation)
- No shared libraries or imports between functions
- Considerable code duplication across functions
- Standardized request/response format

#### Key Functions
- `analyze-citation`: Analyzes web pages for citations
- `execute-query`: Runs queries against AI services
- `process-query`: Coordinates query execution and analysis
- `run-custom-analysis`: Entry point for analysis workflows
- `enhance-client-with-ai`: AI-powered client data enhancement
- `content-brief-generator`: Creates content briefs

#### Authentication Pattern
```typescript
// Common authentication pattern
const supabaseAdmin = createClient(
  Deno.env.get('SUPABASE_URL') ?? '',
  Deno.env.get('SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY') ?? '',
  { auth: { persistSession: false } }
);

// Verify authenticated user
const authHeader = req.headers.get('Authorization');
if (!authHeader) {
  return new Response(JSON.stringify({
    success: false,
    error: 'No authorization header'
  }), {
    headers: { ...corsHeaders, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    status: 401,
  });
}
```

#### Error Handling Pattern
```typescript
try {
  // Function logic
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Error:', error);
  return new Response(JSON.stringify({
    success: false,
    error: error.message || 'Unknown error occurred'
  }), {
    headers: { ...corsHeaders, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    status: 500,
  });
}
```

### Known Issues

1. **Code Duplication**:
   - Authentication logic duplicated across functions
   - Error handling boilerplate repeated
   - Utility functions reimplemented in multiple places

2. **Error Handling Inconsistencies**:
   - Some functions return detailed errors, others generic messages
   - Inconsistent HTTP status code usage
   - Variable logging detail

3. **Authentication Variations**:
   - Mix of JWT verification and Supabase auth
   - Inconsistent permission checks
   - Variable error messages for auth failures

4. **Performance Considerations**:
   - No consistent caching strategy
   - Limited request validation
   - Inefficient data processing patterns

### Deployment Process

Current deployment is manual via the Supabase CLI:
```bash
npx supabase functions deploy [function-name] --project-ref trmaeodthlywcjwfzdka --no-verify-jwt
```

Functions are versioned by creating backup files with suffixes (e.g., `index.ts.backup`).

### Code Quality Assessment

- **Complexity**: Medium (6/10) - Straightforward logic but many edge cases
- **Maintainability**: Low (3/10) - Significant duplication, manual deployment
- **Test Coverage**: Minimal (1/10) - No automated testing
- **Documentation**: Poor (2/10) - Limited inline comments, no API docs

## 3. Frontend Component Architecture

### Current Implementation

The frontend is built with Nuxt 3 and follows a component-based architecture with Tailwind CSS for styling.

#### Directory Structure
- `/components`: UI components organized by feature
- `/composables`: Shared logic using Vue Composition API
- `/pages`: Route components following Nuxt conventions
- `/layouts`: Page layouts including dashboard layout

#### Key Components
- Dashboard components for data visualization
- Analysis tools for running and viewing analyses
- Client management interfaces
- Report visualization components

#### State Management
- Vue Composition API with refs and reactive
- Prop drilling for component communication
- No centralized state management (no Pinia/Vuex)
- Some use of provide/inject for theme

#### Component Pattern
```vue
<template>
  <!-- UI structure -->
</template>

<script setup>
// Imports
import { ref, computed, onMounted } from 'vue'

// Props
const props = defineProps({
  // prop definitions
})

// Local state
const loading = ref(false)
const data = ref(null)

// Methods
const fetchData = async () => {
  // implementation
}

// Lifecycle
onMounted(() => {
  fetchData()
})
</script>

<style scoped>
/* Component styles */
</style>
```
