# Rollback Guide

This document provides comprehensive instructions for rolling back changes made during the refactoring process. It is organized by refactoring phases and includes procedures for different severity levels.

## General Rollback Principles

1. **Safety First**: Always create backups before attempting any rollback procedure
2. **Documentation**: Document all rollback actions taken, including timestamps and outcomes
3. **Verification**: After rollback, verify system functionality using the testing checklist
4. **Communication**: Notify all stakeholders when a rollback is initiated and completed
5. **Root Cause Analysis**: After successful rollback, analyze what went wrong before retrying

## Rollback Decision Matrix

| Severity | Symptoms | Response Time | Approval Needed | Notification List |
|----------|----------|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Critical | Production down, data loss | Immediate | None (act now) | All stakeholders |
| High | Major feature broken, significant performance degradation | < 1 hour | Team Lead | Development team, product owner |
| Medium | Non-critical feature issues, minor performance problems | < 4 hours | Team Lead | Development team |
| Low | Cosmetic issues, edge cases | Next business day | Team Lead | Development team |

## Pre-Rollback Checklist

- [ ] Identify the specific change(s) that need to be rolled back
- [ ] Determine the severity level using the decision matrix
- [ ] Obtain necessary approvals based on severity
- [ ] Create backup of current state
- [ ] Notify appropriate stakeholders
- [ ] Schedule rollback during appropriate window if not critical
- [ ] Prepare verification plan for after rollback

## Phase-Specific Rollback Procedures

### Phase 1: [Phase Name]

#### Complete Phase Rollback

**When to use**: When the entire phase needs to be reverted.

**Prerequisites**:
- Access to git repository with appropriate permissions
- [Any other specific requirements]

**Procedure**:
1. ```bash
   git checkout [pre-phase-1-branch-or-commit]
   ```
2. [Additional steps as needed]
3. Run verification tests: `[command to run tests]`
4. Deploy reverted code: `[deployment command]`
5. Verify system functionality using monitoring dashboard

**Verification**:
1. [Specific verification step]
2. [Specific verification step]
3. Check logs for any new errors

#### Partial Rollbacks

##### Component: [Component A]

**Files affected**:
- `/path/to/file1.ext`
- `/path/to/file2.ext`

**Rollback Procedure**:
1. ```bash
   git checkout [specific-commit] -- /path/to/file1.ext /path/to/file2.ext
   ```
2. [Any additional steps]
3. Run component-specific tests: `[test command]`
4. [Any additional verification]

##### Component: [Component B]

**Files affected**:
- `/path/to/file3.ext`
- `/path/to/file4.ext`

**Rollback Procedure**:
1. [Steps for rolling back component B]
2. [Additional steps]

### Phase 2: [Phase Name]

#### Complete Phase Rollback

**When to use**: When the entire phase needs to be reverted.

**Prerequisites**:
- [Prerequisites]

**Procedure**:
1. [Steps]
2. [Additional steps]

**Verification**:

### Phase 3: [Phase Name]

[Similar structure to previous phases]

## Database Rollback Procedures

### Schema Rollback

**When to use**: When database schema changes need to be reverted.

**Procedure**:
1. ```sql
   -- Example rollback SQL script
   ALTER TABLE [table_name] DROP COLUMN [column_name];
   ```
2. [Additional steps]

**Verification**:
1. [Verification steps]

### Data Rollback

**When to use**: When data migrations or transformations need to be reverted.

**Procedure**:
1. ```sql
   -- Example data rollback script
   UPDATE [table_name] SET [column] = [old_value] WHERE [condition];
   ```
2. [Additional steps]

**Verification**:
1. [Verification steps]

## Configuration Rollback Procedures

**When to use**: When configuration changes need to be reverted.

**Files affected**:
- `/path/to/config1.ext`
- `/path/to/config2.ext`

**Procedure**:
1. [Steps to rollback configuration]
2. [Additional steps]

**Verification**:
1. [Verification steps]

## Dependency Rollback Procedures

**When to use**: When dependency updates need to be reverted.

**Procedure**:
1. ```bash
   # Example for npm
   npm install [package-name]@[previous-version]
   ```
2. [Additional steps]

**Verification**:
1. [Verification steps]

## Post-Rollback Procedures

1. Document the rollback in the REFACTOR_LOG.md file:
   - What was rolled back
   - Why it was rolled back
   - When it was rolled back
   - Who performed the rollback
   - What was the outcome

2. Conduct a team review to determine:
   - Root cause of the issue
   - How to prevent similar issues
   - Plan for re-attempting the change with additional safeguards

3. Update the refactoring plan if necessary

4. Communicate status to all stakeholders
