# Design Principles and Decision Rationale

This document outlines the core design principles guiding our refactoring effort and provides rationales for key architectural decisions. It serves as both a reference for the current refactoring and guidance for future development.

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Separation of Concerns

**Definition:**
Each component should have a single, well-defined responsibility with minimal overlap with other components.

**Application in Our Codebase:**
- UI components should only handle presentation and user interaction
- Business logic should be isolated in dedicated services/composables
- Data access should be abstracted through clear interfaces

**Examples:**
- ✅ API calls encapsulated in service modules
- ✅ UI components that receive data via props and emit events
- ❌ UI components that directly make API calls or modify application state

**Rationale:**
Separating concerns leads to more maintainable, testable, and reusable code. It allows us to change one aspect of the system without affecting others.

### 2. Single Source of Truth

**Definition:**
For any data or state, there should be a single authoritative source that other parts of the application reference.

**Application in Our Codebase:**
- Centralized state management for application-wide data
- Clear ownership of data by specific components or services
- Well-defined data flow patterns

**Examples:**
- ✅ Using Pinia/Vuex stores for shared state
- ✅ Passing state down through props
- ❌ Duplicating state across multiple components

**Rationale:**
Eliminates data synchronization issues and makes the application's behavior more predictable and easier to debug.

### 3. Consistency

**Definition:**
Similar problems should be solved in similar ways throughout the codebase.

**Application in Our Codebase:**
- Consistent file/directory structure
- Consistent naming conventions
- Consistent patterns for common operations (API calls, error handling, etc.)

**Examples:**
- ✅ All component files follow the same structure
- ✅ Consistent naming conventions (e.g., PascalCase for components, camelCase for methods)
- ❌ Multiple ways to handle form validation across the application

**Rationale:**
Reduces cognitive load when navigating the codebase and makes it easier for developers to understand and modify code.

### 4. Performance by Design

**Definition:**
Performance considerations should be built into the architecture rather than added as an afterthought.

**Application in Our Codebase:**
- Efficient data loading strategies
- Appropriate use of caching
- Minimizing unnecessary re-renders

**Examples:**
- ✅ Loading only data needed for current view
- ✅ Implementing proper caching strategies
- ❌ Loading all data upfront regardless of immediate need

**Rationale:**
Ensures the application remains responsive as it scales and as more features are added.

### 5. Security by Default

**Definition:**
All code should be written with security in mind from the start.

**Application in Our Codebase:**
- Proper input validation
- Robust authentication and authorization
- Safe handling of sensitive data

**Examples:**
- ✅ Validating and sanitizing all user inputs
- ✅ Using proper authentication checks
- ❌ Storing sensitive information in client-side storage without encryption

**Rationale:**
Protects user data and system integrity, reduces vulnerabilities, and builds trust.

### 6. Progressive Enhancement

**Definition:**
Core functionality should work for all users, with enhanced functionality for those with more capable browsers or devices.

**Application in Our Codebase:**
- Graceful degradation of features
- Responsive design that works on all screen sizes
- Accessible interface that works with assistive technologies

**Examples:**
- ✅ Implementing responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes
- ✅ Ensuring critical functionality works without JavaScript
- ❌ Features that completely break on older browsers

**Rationale:**
Ensures the application is accessible to the widest possible audience while still taking advantage of modern capabilities.

## Code Style and Conventions

### File Organization

**Directory Structure:**
```
/components/
  /[feature]/
    Component.vue
/composables/
  use[Feature].ts
/services/
  [feature]Service.ts
/types/
  [feature].types.ts
```

**Rationale:**
[Explanation of why this structure was chosen]

### Naming Conventions

- **Components:** PascalCase (e.g., `UserProfile.vue`)
- **Files:** kebab-case for most files, PascalCase for components
- **Functions/Methods:** camelCase (e.g., `getUserData()`)
- **Constants:** UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_RETRY_COUNT`)
- **Variables:** camelCase (e.g., `userData`)
- **CSS Classes:** kebab-case (e.g., `user-profile-container`)

**Rationale:**
[Explanation of naming convention choices]

### Component Structure

```vue
<template>
  <!-- Template structure here -->
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
// Imports
// Props/Emits
// State
// Computed properties
// Methods
// Lifecycle hooks
// Watch
</script>

<style scoped>
/* Component-specific styles */
</style>
```

**Rationale:**
[Explanation of component structure choices]
