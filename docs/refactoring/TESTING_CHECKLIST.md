# Testing Checklist

This document provides a comprehensive testing strategy for our refactoring process. It includes checklists for different types of testing at each phase of the refactor, ensuring that we maintain quality and functionality throughout the process.

## Testing Principles

1. **Test Early, Test Often**: Run tests at every stage of the refactoring process
2. **Test Both Old and New**: Ensure both the original functionality and the refactored code work as expected
3. **Automate Where Possible**: Prefer automated tests over manual verification
4. **Cover Edge Cases**: Don't just test the happy path; test error conditions and edge cases
5. **Performance Matters**: Test not just functionality but also performance implications
6. **Security First**: Ensure security is not compromised during refactoring

## Pre-Refactoring Testing

Before beginning any refactoring work, establish a baseline to validate against later:

- [ ] Run all existing automated tests and ensure they pass
- [ ] Document any existing test failures for reference
- [ ] Measure current performance metrics (load times, response times, etc.)
- [ ] Create snapshots of key UI states for reference
- [ ] Document current API behavior and responses
- [ ] Verify database integrity and performance

## Per-Component Testing Checklist

For each component being refactored:

### Unit Testing

- [ ] All existing unit tests pass with the refactored code
- [ ] New unit tests added for refactored functionality
- [ ] Edge cases and error conditions tested
- [ ] Mocks and stubs correctly implemented
- [ ] Code coverage meets or exceeds pre-refactor levels

### Integration Testing

- [ ] Component interacts correctly with dependencies
- [ ] API interactions behave as expected
- [ ] Events and callbacks function properly
- [ ] Data flow between components is correct
- [ ] Error handling and propagation works as expected

### UI/UX Testing

- [ ] UI renders correctly on all target browsers
- [ ] UI renders correctly on all target devices/screen sizes
- [ ] Accessibility requirements are met
- [ ] User interactions work as expected
- [ ] Visual design matches specifications
- [ ] Performance is acceptable (no noticeable lag or jank)

### Security Testing

- [ ] Input validation is properly implemented
- [ ] Authentication and authorization checks work as expected
- [ ] Sensitive data is properly protected
- [ ] No new security vulnerabilities introduced
- [ ] Security scans pass without new issues

## Cross-Cutting Concerns Testing

### Performance Testing

- [ ] Load testing under expected user load
- [ ] Stress testing beyond expected user load
- [ ] Memory usage monitoring
- [ ] CPU usage monitoring
- [ ] Network request optimization
- [ ] Bundle size analysis
- [ ] Time-to-interactive measurements
- [ ] Database query performance

### Accessibility Testing

- [ ] Screen reader compatibility
- [ ] Keyboard navigation
- [ ] Color contrast ratios
- [ ] Text scaling
- [ ] Focus management
- [ ] ARIA attributes correctly implemented
- [ ] Compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards

### Browser Compatibility Testing

- [ ] Chrome (latest)
- [ ] Firefox (latest)
- [ ] Safari (latest)
- [ ] Edge (latest)
- [ ] Mobile Chrome
- [ ] Mobile Safari

### Database Testing

- [ ] All database migrations work correctly
- [ ] Rollback scripts function as expected
- [ ] Database performance is acceptable
- [ ] Data integrity is maintained
- [ ] No unexpected data loss

### End-to-End Testing

- [ ] Critical user flows function correctly
- [ ] Authentication and authorization work as expected
- [ ] Form submissions and data saving function correctly
- [ ] Navigation works as expected
- [ ] Error states and recovery function correctly

## Regression Testing

After each phase of refactoring:

- [ ] All automated tests pass
- [ ] Manual testing of critical paths completed
- [ ] Performance testing shows no degradation
- [ ] Security testing shows no new vulnerabilities
- [ ] Accessibility testing shows no new issues
- [ ] No new bugs introduced in unchanged areas

## Post-Refactoring Validation

After completing all refactoring work:

- [ ] All automated tests pass
- [ ] Manual testing of all critical user flows completed
- [ ] Performance metrics meet or exceed pre-refactor baseline
- [ ] Security scans pass without new issues
- [ ] Accessibility compliance verified
- [ ] Code quality metrics reviewed
- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect new architecture
- [ ] Technical debt assessed and documented

## Test Data Management

- [ ] Test data created for all key scenarios
- [ ] Test data is isolated from production data
- [ ] Test data can be easily reset or regenerated
- [ ] Sensitive data is properly obscured in test environments

## Test Environment Management

- [ ] Development environment configured for testing
- [ ] Staging environment matches production configuration
- [ ] Test database properly configured
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline updated for refactored codebase

## Testing Tools

- **Unit Testing**: [Tool name and version]
- **Integration Testing**: [Tool name and version]
- **E2E Testing**: [Tool name and version]
- **Performance Testing**: [Tool name and version]
- **Accessibility Testing**: [Tool name and version]
- **Security Testing**: [Tool name and version]

## Test Issue Triage Process

When a test fails during refactoring:

1. **Document the Issue**
   - Test that failed
   - Expected vs. actual behavior
   - Environment details
   - Reproduction steps

2. **Prioritize**
   - Critical: Blocks further refactoring, needs immediate fix
   - High: Important functionality broken, fix before moving forward
   - Medium: Issue should be fixed but doesn't block progress
   - Low: Minor issue that can be addressed later

3. **Investigate**
   - Determine if it's a refactoring regression or pre-existing issue
   - Identify the specific change that caused the regression
   - Determine if it's isolated or affects multiple components

4. **Resolve**
   - Fix the issue
   - Add a new test case to prevent future regressions
   - Document the fix in the refactoring log

## Test Reporting

After each testing cycle:

- [ ] Generate test coverage report
- [ ] Document any test failures and resolutions
- [ ] Compare performance metrics with baseline
- [ ] Update testing checklist status
- [ ] Communicate testing results to the team
