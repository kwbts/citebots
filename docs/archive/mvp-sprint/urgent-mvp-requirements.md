# Citebots Vision & MVP Requirements

## URGENT BUSINESS CONTEXT

**Business turning point**: Currently experiencing low revenue period  
**Immediate opportunity**: Potential to close a deal with this MVP  
**Timeline**: Weekend development sprint while family is away  
**Goal**: Working demo to show wife and prospects  

## Core Purpose

- Internal application for SEO/digital marketing AI consultancy
- Tool to help organizations optimize content for citations in LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity)
- Differentiated service offering with client-accessible dashboards

## MVP Requirements (High Priority)

### Basic Setup
- Deployed site on Netlify with custom domain
- User authentication (just for you and employee)
- Future-proof database structure

### Core Functionality
- Ability to run citation analysis
- Store client data securely
- Generate basic reports
- Create view-only links for clients

### Data Architecture
- Client-specific data storage
- Anonymized benchmark data collection
- Support for tracking citations over time

## Development Approach

**CRITICAL**: Small, incremental, validated steps
- Front-load backend functionality testing
- Avoid complex front-end before validating connections
- Start with simplest working version

## Future Extensions (Not MVP)

- White-labeling for partners/consultants
- Tenant provisioning (will be manual even later)
- Advanced reporting and tracking features
- Client management by partners

## Business Model

- NOT a public SaaS product
- Internal tool + client-facing dashboard
- Potential white-label offering to select partners
- Focus on analysis and recommendations, not rank tracking

## Competitive Advantage

- More comprehensive than existing tools
- Cost-efficient service delivery
- Advanced visualization and insights
- Monthly core sample reports for marketing/benchmarking

**Development priority**: Working functionality over perfect UI. Focus on validated connections to Supabase and core data processing capabilities first.
