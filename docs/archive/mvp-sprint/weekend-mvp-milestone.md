## Demo Script Validation

1. **Opening**: "Internal tool for citation analysis"
2. **Login**: Show secure authentication
3. **Client View**: Display test client
4. **Analysis**: Trigger and show progress
5. **Results**: Display citation data
6. **Sharing**: Generate client link

8. **Future**: "This weekend's foundation enables..."

## Fallback Positions

If blockers occur:

### Plan A (Full Demo)
- Live site with all features

### Plan B (Partial Demo)
- Core features + mock some parts
- Emphasize working backend

### Plan C (Architecture Demo)
- Show Supabase data
- Explain architecture
- Mock frontend interactions

## Business Talking Points

1. **Immediate Value**: "Clients can access their data today"
2. **Differentiation**: "More comprehensive than competitors"
3. **Scalability**: "Architecture supports white-labeling"
4. **Timeline**: "Full MVP in 2-3 weeks"
5. **Investment**: "Minimal ongoing costs"

## Post-Demo Next Steps

1. Gather feedback
2. Close the deal
3. Plan 2-week sprint
4. Hire additional help if needed

Remember: **Working backend > Perfect UI**
