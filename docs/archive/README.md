# Archived Documentation

This directory contains archived documentation that is no longer actively maintained but kept for historical reference.

## Structure

```
archive/
├── mvp-sprint/       # Initial MVP sprint documentation (archived Jan 2025)
├── 2025-01/          # January 2025 updates

```

## Archive Contents

### MVP Sprint
The `mvp-sprint` folder contains documentation from the initial MVP development sprint. These documents represent the planning and implementation of the first version of Citebots.

### Date-Based Archives
Date-based folders (like `2025-01`) contain documentation that was superseded by newer versions or is no longer relevant to the current project state.

## When to Archive

Documents should be archived when:
1. They represent a historical milestone that is no longer actively used
2. They have been superseded by newer, more accurate documentation
3. They reference features or approaches that have been deprecated

## How to Reference Archived Documents

When referencing archived documents from current documentation, use the following format:
```
[Document Title](/docs/archive/folder/document.md) (Archived: Month YYYY)
```

## Archive Management

Archives should be periodically reviewed to ensure they remain relevant for historical context. Documents that are completely obsolete may be removed from the archive after 1 year.
