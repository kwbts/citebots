# Content Brief Generator Implementation Plan

This document outlines the step-by-step approach to implementing the Content Brief Generator feature. Each step is designed to be small and testable to ensure incremental progress and validation.

## Phase 1: Requirements and UI Review

### Step 1: UI Structure Redesign
- [x] Design split-page UI structure with separate setup and results pages **(COMPLETED)**
- [x] Refactor existing page to focus only on brief setup parameters **(COMPLETED)**
- [x] Create new results page for displaying generated briefs **(COMPLETED)**
- [x] Implement navigation flow between the two pages **(COMPLETED)**
- [ ] Ensure responsive design works across all device sizes

> **Current Status**: We have completed the UI structure design, documenting how to split the content brief generator into separate setup and results pages. See `ui-structure.md` for the detailed design. We're now moving to implementation of this two-page approach through the micro steps defined in `micro-steps.md`.

### Step 2: Define API Contract
- [ ] Document the exact input and output structure for the edge function
- [ ] Define request/response JSON schemas
- [ ] Outline error handling and edge cases
- [ ] Create API documentation for frontend-backend integration

## Phase 2: Edge Function Development

### Step 3: Setup Basic Edge Function Structure
- [ ] Create `content-brief-generator` edge function directory
- [ ] Set up base function with CORS support
- [ ] Implement authentication and client data validation
- [ ] Create test endpoint to verify connectivity from frontend

### Step 4: Client Data Integration
- [ ] Add function to fetch client profile from Supabase
- [ ] Merge client data with user inputs
- [ ] Structure enhanced input data for further processing
- [ ] Implement function to fetch and integrate client competitors

### Step 5: AI Query Generation
- [ ] Create function to analyze input and generate research queries
- [ ] Implement OpenAI integration for query generation
- [ ] Ensure diverse query types (informational, commercial, etc.)
- [ ] Build filtering mechanism to select the best 3 queries

## Phase 3: Research Collection

### Step 6: LLM Research Integration
- [ ] Implement integration with ChatGPT API
- [ ] Add Perplexity API integration
- [ ] Create function to send generated queries to LLMs
- [ ] Process and store LLM responses

### Step 7: Google Search Integration
- [ ] Set up Google Search API connection
- [ ] Create function to execute searches with the primary keyword
- [ ] Add function for domain-specific searches (site:example.com "keyword")
- [ ] Extract and store search results

### Step 8: Web Content Scraping
- [ ] Integrate ScrapingBee API
- [ ] Implement function to scrape content from search results
- [ ] Add content extraction and cleaning
- [ ] Set up error handling for scraping failures

## Phase 4: Content Analysis

### Step 9: Content Analysis System
- [ ] Create function to analyze scraped content
- [ ] Implement competitor analysis logic
- [ ] Add information architecture analysis
- [ ] Build internal linking suggestions system

### Step 10: AI Content Review
- [ ] Develop OpenAI prompts for content analysis
- [ ] Create function to process content through GPT
- [ ] Extract insights about competitive advantages
- [ ] Generate content structure recommendations

## Phase 5: Brief Generation

### Step 11: Table of Contents Generation
- [ ] Create function to generate structured TOC
- [ ] Implement narrative flow analysis
- [ ] Add sub-section generation with explanatory bullets
- [ ] Ensure TOC follows the template guidelines (max 7 sections, 4 sub-bullets)

### Step 12: Research Links Compilation
- [ ] Develop function to identify high-quality external sources
- [ ] Implement filtering to exclude competitor domains
- [ ] Add prioritization of sources with statistics and data
- [ ] Create verification system for source quality

### Step 13: Content Suggestions Creation
- [ ] Build function to generate specific content suggestions
- [ ] Implement importance scoring system (9.5/10 threshold)
- [ ] Ensure suggestions are specific, not generic
- [ ] Limit to maximum of 5 high-importance suggestions

### Step 14: Brief Assembly
- [ ] Create function to assemble all components into final brief
- [ ] Implement formatting for readability
- [ ] Add metadata about generation process
- [ ] Format output according to template standards

## Phase 6: Integration and Testing

### Step 15: Frontend-Backend Integration
- [ ] Connect frontend form to edge function
- [ ] Implement error handling and retry logic
- [ ] Add progress indicators for multi-step process
- [ ] Create user feedback mechanisms

### Step 16: Result Display
- [ ] Design and implement brief display component
- [ ] Add export functionality (PDF, DOCX)
- [ ] Implement copy-to-clipboard features
- [ ] Create save/history functionality

### Step 17: Comprehensive Testing
- [ ] Create unit tests for each function
- [ ] Implement integration tests for the complete flow
- [ ] Perform UI/UX testing
- [ ] Conduct performance testing (response times, memory usage)

## Phase 7: Refinement and Launch

### Step 18: Performance Optimization
- [ ] Identify and resolve bottlenecks
- [ ] Implement caching where appropriate
- [ ] Add batch processing for heavy operations
- [ ] Optimize API calls to external services

### Step 19: User Feedback Loop
- [ ] Add user rating system for generated briefs
- [ ] Implement feedback collection mechanism
- [ ] Create dashboard for feedback analysis
- [ ] Establish process for continuous improvement

### Step 20: Documentation and Launch
- [ ] Create user documentation
- [ ] Add system architecture documentation
- [ ] Prepare launch materials (announcements, tutorials)
- [ ] Final QA and launch

## Implementation Notes

### APIs and Integrations
- OpenAI API for query generation and content analysis
- Perplexity API for research
- Google Search API for search results
- ScrapingBee for web content extraction
