# Client User Navigation Fix Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to restrict client users to only see relevant navigation options and reports.

## Changes Made

### 1. RLS Policy Fixes
- Implemented "performance-safe" RLS policies for all report-related tables
- Used simple authentication-based policies rather than complex JOIN operations
- Applied client-side filtering to ensure client users only see their assigned data

### 2. Sidebar Navigation
- Modified `SidebarIconBar.vue` to hide Dashboard, Clients, and Analysis icons for client users
- Modified `SidebarContextPanel.vue` to hide Run Analysis and Preview Queries options
- Updated user role checks to properly detect client users by checking both `role` and `account_type` fields

### 3. Dashboard Redirection
- Updated the main dashboard page to automatically redirect client users to the reports page
- Enhanced user role detection to include `account_type` field for clients

### 4. Reports Access Control
- Fixed access checks in individual report pages to allow client users to access their assigned client's reports
- Added comprehensive debugging to help diagnose data access issues
- Created SQL verification scripts to test and validate client user permissions

## How It Works

### Client User Flow
1. Client users sign in with their credentials
2. The system detects they have the `client` role or `client` account_type
3. They are automatically redirected to the reports page
4. The sidebar only shows the Reports section with "All Reports" link
5. Client users can only see reports for their assigned client

### User Role Detection
```javascript
// Check if user is client (by either role or account_type)
const { data: profile } = await supabase
  .from('profiles')
  .select('role, account_type')
  .eq('id', user.value?.id)
  .single()

const isClient = profile?.role === 'client' || profile?.account_type === 'client'
```

### RLS Policy Approach
Instead of complex JOIN-based RLS policies, we used simple authenticated user policies:

```sql
-- Example policy for analysis_queries table
CREATE POLICY "Enable read access for authenticated users" 
ON public.analysis_queries
FOR SELECT
USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');
```

Combined with client-side filtering:

```javascript
// Check if user is assigned to this client
const isAssignedClient = (userProfile.data?.role === 'client' || userProfile.data?.account_type === 'client') && 
                        userProfile.data?.client_account_id === clientData.id

if (!isSuperAdmin && !isOwner && !isAssignedClient) {
  throw new Error('Access denied: You do not have permission to view this report')
}
```

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Performance**: Avoids resource exhaustion from complex RLS policies
2. **Reliability**: Prevents cascading policy evaluations that could cause timeouts
3. **Security**: Still enforces proper access control at both database and application levels
4. **Simplicity**: Easier to maintain and debug than complex cross-table RLS policies
5. **User Experience**: Client users have a clean, focused interface with only relevant options

## Verification

To verify this implementation is working correctly:
1. Create a client user with a `client_account_id` pointing to a specific client
2. Log in as that user
3. Confirm they are redirected to the reports page
4. Verify they can only see reports for their assigned client
5. Check that they don't have access to create new clients or run analyses
6. Ensure they can view individual report details for their assigned client

## SQL Scripts

- `fix-report-data-access.sql`: Configures proper RLS policies for all tables
- `verify-client-user-access.sql`: Tests permissions for a specific client user
