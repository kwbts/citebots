# Analysis System Fix: Implementing Queue-Based Architecture

## Problem Summary

The Citebots analysis system was encountering three critical issues:

1. **Edge Function Timeouts (504 errors)**
   - Supabase edge functions hitting 10-second timeout limit
   - CORS headers never sent when timeout occurs
   - Browser errors due to missing CORS headers

2. **Unreliable Web Scraping**
   - ScrapingBee integration failing on many websites
   - Missing data when scraping difficult sites

3. **Database Schema Inconsistencies**
   - Missing columns in page_analyses table
   - Error handling issues across edge functions

## Solution Overview

We successfully implemented a queue-based architecture that:

1. **Returns Immediate Response**
   - Sends CORS headers early in the request lifecycle
   - Returns success with queued state before timeout occurs
   - Avoids edge function timeout errors

2. **Processes in Background**
   - Handles queries asynchronously via worker function
   - Implements retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Tracks progress in database for frontend polling

3. **Adds Defensive Programming**
   - Handles schema inconsistencies with runtime column checks
   - Implements progressive enhancement for web scraping
   - Improves error capturing and reporting

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Infrastructure
- Created `analysis_queue` table with proper indexes
- Implemented database functions for queue operations
- Added RLS policies for security

### 2. Edge Function Improvements
- **run-custom-analysis**: Added queue support with feature flags
- **process-queue-worker**: New function to process queue items
- **analyze-citation**: Enhanced error handling and schema validation
- **All functions**: Early CORS header sending

### 3. Feature Flags
- Added `X-Use-Queue` header to explicitly enable queue processing
- Implemented automatic detection for large query batches
- Included fallback to queue if direct processing fails

### 4. ScrapingBee Enhancements
- Implemented progressive enhancement strategy
- Added domain-specific crawling options
- Created automatic retry with improved parameters

## Function Chain Architecture

The system now supports two processing paths:

### Direct Processing (Small Batches)
```
run-custom-analysis → process-query → execute-query → analyze-citation
```

### Queue Processing (Large Batches)
```
run-custom-analysis → [queue to database] → process-queue-worker → process-query → execute-query → analyze-citation
```

## Results & Benefits

- ✅ **Timeout Resistance**: Large jobs continue in background
- ✅ **CORS Issues Fixed**: Headers sent immediately
- ✅ **Improved Resilience**: Failed operations retry automatically
- ✅ **Better UX**: Frontend can show processing progress
- ✅ **Scalability**: System handles larger query batches
- ✅ **Schema Adaptability**: Functions work with varying schema versions

## Deployment Steps

1. **Database Schema**: Added queue tables and functions
2. **Edge Functions**: Updated with queue support and error handling
3. **Testing**: Verified with various batch sizes and scenarios

## Next Steps

1. **Frontend Integration**: Update UI to pass the `X-Use-Queue` header
2. **Progress Display**: Add polling for queue status
3. **Monitoring Dashboard**: Create admin view for queue status
4. **Performance Optimization**: Fine-tune batch sizes and processing
5. **Analytics**: Add timing metrics for operations
