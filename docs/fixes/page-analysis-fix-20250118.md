# Page Analysis Fix - January 18, 2025

## Issue
Page analyses were not being created or stored in the database, resulting in empty `associated_pages` arrays even for queries with citations.

## Root Causes
1. **Missing API Keys**: The ScrapingBee and OpenAI API keys were not set in Supabase edge function environment
2. **Missing Database Column**: The `associated_pages` JSONB column was missing from the `analysis_queries` table
3. **Defensive Programming**: Edge functions needed better error handling for undefined/null arrays

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Added Missing Column
Created the `associated_pages` column in the `analysis_queries` table:
```sql
ALTER TABLE public.analysis_queries 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS associated_pages JSONB DEFAULT '[]'::JSONB;
```

### 2. Updated Edge Functions
Fixed defensive programming in all edge functions to handle undefined arrays:
- `analyze-citation/index.ts`
- `process-query/index.ts`
- `execute-query/index.ts`

Key fixes:
- Added `Array.isArray()` checks before accessing `.length`
- Added null/undefined guards for object properties
- Provided fallback defaults for missing data

### 3. Set Required API Keys
```bash
npx supabase secrets set SCRAPINGBEE_API_KEY=your_key
npx supabase secrets set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key
```

### 4. Deployed Updated Functions
```bash
npx supabase functions deploy analyze-citation --no-verify-jwt
npx supabase functions deploy process-query --no-verify-jwt
npx supabase functions deploy execute-query --no-verify-jwt
```

## Results
- ✅ Page analyses are now being created successfully
- ✅ `associated_pages` array is populated with analysis data
- ✅ Citation analysis workflow is functioning properly
- ✅ All fields are being mapped correctly

## Key Learnings
1. Always check edge function environment variables/secrets
2. Ensure database schema matches what edge functions expect
3. Implement comprehensive defensive programming for edge cases
4. Test edge functions independently to isolate issues

## Monitoring
To verify everything continues working:
```sql
-- Check for recent page analyses
SELECT 
    id,
    query_text,
    citation_count,
    associated_pages_count,
    jsonb_array_length(associated_pages) as actual_pages
FROM public.analysis_queries
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
    AND citation_count > 0
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```
