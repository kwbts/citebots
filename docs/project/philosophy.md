# Development Philosophy

## Core Principles

The Citebots development approach follows these foundational principles:

### MVP-Focused (URGENT)

- **Immediate Goal**: Working demo for business opportunity
- Build in small, validated increments
- Backend functionality over UI polish
- Ship working features within weekend sprint

### Priority on Validation

- Validate Supabase connection first
- Test core data operations before UI
- Ensure fundamental integrations work
- Demonstrate business value quickly

### Validation Steps

Our development process follows a structured validation approach:

1. **First Milestone**: Supabase connection and data storage
2. **Second Milestone**: Netlify deployment and LLM integration
3. **Third Milestone**: User authentication security and basic reporting

### Foundation-First

- Create expandable architecture that supports future additions
- Implement clean separation of concerns
- Document core functions thoroughly
- Prioritize maintainable, extensible code structures

## Technical Implementation Strategy

- Focus on complete architecture before feature depth
- Validate critical integrations early (Supabase, Netlify, AI services)
- Build foundation components before advanced features
- Document progress with detailed changelog entries

## Design Principles

- Prioritize usability over aesthetics
- Implement responsive design from the start
- Follow established UI patterns for dashboard interfaces
- Design for scalability as data volume grows
