# Session 3 Notes - AI Enhancement Implementation

## Date: May 17, 2025

## Context
Continuing work on the Citebots project after hitting context window limits in session 2. Focus was on implementing AI enhancement for client provisioning using Supabase Edge Functions.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Edge Function Implementation
- Created `enhance-client-with-ai` edge function for AI-powered client data enrichment
- Integrated with Perplexity AI and OpenAI APIs for intelligent data extraction
- Implemented structured data parsing to convert AI responses into clean, usable arrays

### 2. CORS Issue Resolution
- Encountered persistent CORS errors when invoking edge function from the browser
- Fixed by properly implementing CORS headers according to Supabase documentation:
  ```typescript
  const corsHeaders = {
    'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*',
    'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': 'authorization, x-client-info, apikey, content-type',
  }
  ```
- Properly handled preflight OPTIONS requests

### 3. Error Handling Improvements
- Added comprehensive error logging to edge function
- Implemented detailed error responses showing which API keys are missing
- Added client-side error logging for better debugging

### 4. Frontend Integration
- Updated client provisioning page to use AI enhancement
- Fixed competitor data structure handling (nested object issue)
- Added visual indicators for AI-enhanced fields
- Implemented proper state management for loading/error states

### 5. Alternative Implementation
- Created local API endpoint (`/api/enhance-client-ai`) as a backup solution
- Ultimately reverted to edge function approach as the preferred method
- Local API remains available as a fallback option

## Technical Challenges Resolved

### 1. Edge Function Deployment
- Initial attempts to use Supabase CLI failed due to authentication issues
- Resolved by manually creating the function in Supabase dashboard
- Set up environment variables for API keys directly in Supabase

### 2. Response Structure Issues
- Fixed incorrect access path for competitors data
- Changed from `result.competitors` to `result.competitors.competitors`
- Ensured all array fields are properly initialized as empty arrays

### 3. Missing Dependencies
- Installed required packages (openai, supabase CLI)
- Set up proper environment variables in `.env` file

## Files Modified/Created

### Created:
- `/supabase/functions/enhance-client-with-ai/index.ts` - Main edge function
- `/supabase/functions/_shared/cors.ts` - Shared CORS configuration
- `/server/api/enhance-client-ai.post.ts` - Alternative local API implementation
- `/scripts/deploy-edge-function.sh` - Deployment helper script
- `/scripts/set-edge-function-env.sh` - Environment variable setup script

### Modified:
- `/composables/useAIEnhancement.ts` - Updated to handle edge function properly
- `/pages/dashboard/clients/provision.vue` - Fixed competitor data handling
- `/pages/dashboard/clients/edit-client-[id].vue` - Added error logging

## Current Status

### Working:
- ✅ AI enhancement feature fully functional
- ✅ CORS issues resolved
- ✅ Edge function deployed and accessible
- ✅ Client data successfully enhanced with AI
- ✅ Competitors properly added from AI suggestions

### Pending:
- May need to optimize API call performance
- Consider caching AI responses to reduce API costs
- Add retry logic for failed API calls
- Implement rate limiting

## Deployment Notes

1. Edge function must be manually created in Supabase dashboard
2. Required environment variables:
   - `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
3. Function name must be exactly: `enhance-client-with-ai`
4. CORS headers must match Supabase documentation exactly

## Lessons Learned

1. Supabase edge functions have specific CORS requirements
2. Manual deployment through dashboard can be more reliable than CLI
3. Proper error logging is crucial for debugging edge functions
4. Response structure must be carefully validated on both frontend and backend

## Next Steps

1. Implement caching layer for AI responses
2. Add retry logic for failed API calls
3. Create rate limiting to prevent API abuse
4. Add more granular error handling for specific API failures
5. Consider implementing batch processing for multiple clients

## Code Snippets

### Correct CORS Implementation:
```typescript
if (req.method === 'OPTIONS') {
  return new Response('ok', { headers: corsHeaders })
}
```

### Proper Error Response:
```typescript
return new Response(
  JSON.stringify(errorResponse),
  {
    headers: { ...corsHeaders, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    status: 400
  }
)
```

## Summary

Session 3 successfully implemented the AI enhancement feature for client provisioning. The main challenge was resolving CORS issues with the Supabase edge function, which required careful attention to documentation and proper header configuration. The feature now works seamlessly, enhancing client data with industry information, competitors, and other business insights from AI services.
