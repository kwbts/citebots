# Session 4 Notes - Full Analysis Implementation

## Date: May 17, 2025

## Context
Continued work on the Citebots project after successfully implementing the AI enhancement feature in session 3. This session focused on building the complete analysis functionality to replicate the original citebots script within the Nuxt/Supabase architecture.

## Overview
We implemented the full analysis pipeline that allows users to:
1. Select a client and platform (ChatGPT/Perplexity)
2. Run analysis with test keywords or client keywords
3. Process queries through AI platforms
4. Crawl and analyze citations using ScrapingBee
5. Store comprehensive analysis data in Supabase
6. View results in a dedicated analysis page

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Fixed Authentication Issues
- Resolved the duplicate Supabase client instances issue by removing custom composables
- Updated all pages to use built-in Nuxt Supabase module composables
- Fixed middleware to use `useSupabaseClient()` instead of custom implementation

### 2. Database Schema Implementation
Created comprehensive analysis tables with proper RLS:
- `analysis_runs` - Tracks analysis sessions
- `analysis_queries` - Stores individual query results  
- `page_analyses` - Stores detailed page crawl data
- `benchmark_data` - Anonymized data for industry comparisons

### 3. Edge Functions Created
Implemented a complete analysis pipeline with these edge functions:

#### execute-query
- Handles API calls to ChatGPT and Perplexity
- Extracts citations from responses
- Detects brand mentions

#### analyze-citation  
- Crawls pages using ScrapingBee API
- Extracts technical SEO data, content metrics, and performance indicators
- Uses OpenAI to analyze content quality and relevance
- Captures all data points from original citebots script

#### process-query
- Orchestrates the full query analysis
- Creates query records
- Calls execute-query for AI responses
- Processes each citation through analyze-citation
- Updates progress in real-time

#### run-analysis (updated)
- Main orchestration function
- Creates analysis runs
- Generates queries based on keywords and intents
- Handles both test mode and full analysis mode
- Manages the overall analysis workflow

### 4. Comprehensive Data Capture
Implemented full citebots data structure including:
- Technical SEO metrics
- Page performance data
- Domain authority information
- On-page SEO analysis
- Content quality scoring
- AI-powered content analysis
- Brand and competitor detection

### 5. User Interface Updates
- Created analysis page with client dropdown
- Added test mode with manual keyword input
- Implemented results preview
- Created detailed analysis results page
- Added real-time progress tracking

### 6. Fixed Configuration Issues
- Corrected client ownership column (`created_by` vs `user_id`)
- Implemented proper CORS headers for edge functions
- Set up environment variables correctly

## Technical Challenges Resolved

### 1. Supabase Module Issues
- Fixed duplicate client instances by removing custom useSupabase composable
- Updated all imports to use built-in Nuxt Supabase module

### 2. Database Column Mismatch
- Discovered clients table uses `created_by` instead of `user_id`
- Updated all queries and RLS policies accordingly

### 3. Edge Function Integration
- Implemented proper service role authentication
- Set up inter-function communication
- Handled CORS issues with correct headers

### 4. ScrapingBee Integration
- Adapted the original Node.js implementation to Deno
- Simplified HTML parsing for edge function environment
- Maintained all essential data extraction

## Current Status

### Working Features
- ✅ Complete analysis workflow from UI to data storage
- ✅ Test mode for quick validation
- ✅ Full citebots data capture
- ✅ ScrapingBee integration for web crawling
- ✅ AI-powered content analysis
- ✅ Results visualization page
- ✅ Real-time progress tracking

### Data Flow
1. User selects client and platform
2. System creates analysis run record
3. Generates queries based on keywords × intents
4. For each query:
   - Calls AI platform (ChatGPT/Perplexity)
   - Extracts citations
   - Crawls each citation with ScrapingBee
   - Analyzes content with OpenAI
   - Stores comprehensive metrics
5. User views results on analysis detail page

## Files Modified/Created

### Edge Functions
- `/supabase/functions/execute-query/index.ts` - AI platform integration
- `/supabase/functions/analyze-citation/index.ts` - Web crawling and analysis
- `/supabase/functions/process-query/index.ts` - Query processing pipeline
- `/supabase/functions/run-analysis/index.ts` - Updated main orchestration

### Database
- `/scripts/create-analysis-tables.sql` - Complete schema with RLS

### Frontend
- `/pages/dashboard/analysis/index.vue` - Main analysis page
- `/pages/dashboard/analysis/[id].vue` - Results detail page
- Fixed imports in multiple existing pages

## Environment Variables Required
In Supabase Edge Functions settings:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` 
- `SCRAPINGBEE_API_KEY`

## Next Steps
1. Implement visualization dashboards for analysis data
2. Add export functionality for reports
3. Create shareable client links
4. Implement batch processing for multiple clients
5. Add scheduling for regular analysis runs
6. Optimize performance for large-scale crawling

## Deployment Notes
1. All edge functions must be deployed to Supabase
2. Environment variables must be set in Supabase dashboard
3. Database migrations must be run to create new tables
4. Frontend can be deployed to Netlify as usual

## Testing Validation
The system successfully:
- Creates analysis runs
- Processes test queries
- Returns real AI responses
- Crawls web pages
- Analyzes content
- Stores all metrics
- Displays results

The complete citebots functionality is now integrated into the Nuxt/Supabase architecture.
