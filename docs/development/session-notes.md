# Session Notes - May 17, 2025

## Summary
Successfully implemented authentication and dashboard with profile display. Fixed critical RLS infinite recursion issue.

## Key Accomplishments
1. Implemented Supabase authentication
2. Created working login flow
3. Fixed profile display on dashboard
4. Resolved RLS infinite recursion error
5. Cleaned up all test/debug pages
6. Established clean codebase

## Technical Issues Resolved

### RLS Infinite Recursion
- **Problem**: Policies were referencing the profiles table itself (checking role = 'super_admin')
- **Solution**: Simplified policies to only check auth.uid() = id
- **Final Fix**: Ran SQL script to drop all policies and create simple ones

### Password Retrieval
- **Problem**: Password not showing after account creation
- **Solution**: Password is stored in access_requests table, created debug tools to retrieve

### Profile Not Loading
- **Problem**: Dashboard showed empty profile despite successful login
- **Solution**: Fixed RLS policies and ensured profile exists during auth provision

## Current Architecture

### Pages
- `/` - Login page (Sign In / Request Access)
- `/dashboard` - Authenticated dashboard with profile display

### Netlify Functions
- `auth-provision.js` - Handles account creation and password generation

### Database
- `profiles` table with simplified RLS
- `access_requests` table for account provisioning

## Next Session Priorities

1. **Client Management CRUD**
   - Create clients table
   - Add client list view
   - Add/edit/delete clients
   - Client detail pages

2. **Analysis Integration**
   - Connect web scraping algorithm
   - Create analysis trigger
   - Store results

3. **Results Display**
   - Show analysis results
   - Citation lists
   - Filtering/sorting

## Important Notes
- Always use Netlify Functions, not Nuxt server routes
- Use singleton pattern for Supabase client
- Keep RLS policies simple (no cross-table references)
- Test changes on deployed site (push to GitHub)
- Dashboard requires valid profile record to display data

## Environment
- Nuxt 3 with static deployment
- Supabase for backend
- Netlify for hosting
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- TypeScript when beneficial
