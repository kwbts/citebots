# Notes for Next Claude Code Session

## Recent Work Completed (May 2025)

### Queue Processing System Implementation
- Successfully implemented a queue-based processing system for handling large analysis runs
- Fixed issues with duplicate analysis runs when using both platforms
- Added auto-recovery for stalled queue processing
- Increased worker processing capacity with parallel execution

### Key Files Modified
- `/supabase/functions/run-custom-analysis/index.ts` - Fixed to use a single analysis run
- `/supabase/functions/process-queue-worker/index.ts` - Added delays and improved data field mapping
- `/components/analysis/QueueProgress.vue` - New component for progress tracking
- `/composables/useQueueAnalysis.ts` - New composable for queue management

### Current Status
- Queue system is working well for large batches of queries
- Single analysis runs for "both" platforms (no more duplicates)
- Auto-recovery for stalled processing
- Overall more stability and reliability in the processing system

### Remaining Issues to Address
1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Consider adding database indexes for faster queue processing
   - Optimize query batching for even faster processing

2. **Enhanced Monitoring**
   - Could add admin dashboard for monitoring all running analyses
   - Add detailed error reporting for failed queries

3. **UI Improvements**
   - Consider adding more detailed progress view with estimated completion time
   - Add option to cancel running analyses

### Important Notes
- Always use `~/` instead of `@/` for imports in Nuxt 3
- Use `useSupabaseClient()` and `useSupabaseUser()` from `#imports` instead of custom composables
- The queue worker uses a batch size of 10 by default
- Queue processing is now the default method for all analyses with more than 1 query

## Deployment Info
- Last deployed: May 21, 2025
- Edge functions deployed manually to Supabase
- Frontend deployed through Netlify automated builds

**Note**: All changes have been committed to the main branch on GitHub. The system is in a stable state with no known critical bugs.
