# Refactoring Principles

This document outlines the design principles, rationales, and architectural decisions guiding our refactoring efforts. It serves as a reference for the team to ensure consistent decision-making throughout the process.

## Core Principles

### 1. Maintainability Over Cleverness

**Principle**: We prioritize code that is easy to understand and maintain over code that is clever or overly concise.

**Rationale**: The majority of development time is spent reading and understanding code, not writing it. Clear code reduces onboarding time for new developers and decreases the likelihood of bugs.

**Implementation Guidelines**:
- Prefer explicit code over implicit behavior
- Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes
- Break complex functions into smaller, focused functions
- Add comments to explain "why" not "what" (the code should explain what)

---

### 2. Consistency in Patterns and Practices

**Principle**: We establish and follow consistent patterns across the codebase.

**Rationale**: Consistency makes the codebase more predictable, which improves developer productivity and reduces mistakes.

**Implementation Guidelines**:
- Define standard patterns for common operations (e.g., data access, error handling)
- Establish naming conventions and enforce them
- Use the same solution for the same problem throughout the codebase
- Document patterns in a central location and reference them in code

---

### 3. Modularity and Clear Boundaries

**Principle**: We organize code into modules with clear responsibilities and well-defined interfaces.

**Rationale**: Modularity allows components to be developed, tested, and maintained independently, which improves team efficiency and reduces the risk of changes.

**Implementation Guidelines**:
- Define clear module boundaries
- Minimize dependencies between modules
- Design interfaces before implementations
- Enforce encapsulation to hide implementation details
- Use dependency injection to manage cross-module dependencies

---

### 4. Performance as a Feature

**Principle**: We consider performance implications in our design decisions but balance them with other principles.

**Rationale**: Performance is an essential aspect of user experience, but premature optimization can lead to complex, hard-to-maintain code.

**Implementation Guidelines**:
- Establish performance benchmarks and metrics
- Profile before optimizing
- Document performance-critical sections
- Prefer readable code, optimize only when necessary
- Test performance implications of architectural changes

---

### 5. Test-Driven Refactoring

**Principle**: We ensure that all refactored code is covered by tests, preferably written before refactoring.

**Rationale**: Tests provide a safety net that allows us to refactor with confidence. They also serve as documentation for how the code should behave.

**Implementation Guidelines**:
- Ensure comprehensive test coverage before refactoring
- Write additional tests to cover edge cases
- Use tests to validate that behavior hasn't changed
- Include performance tests for critical paths
- Maintain and update tests as part of the refactoring process

## Code Style and Conventions

### Naming Conventions

- **Variables**: [Convention, e.g., "camelCase, descriptive names"]
- **Functions**: [Convention, e.g., "camelCase, verb + noun"]
- **Classes**: [Convention, e.g., "PascalCase, noun"]
- **Interfaces**: [Convention, e.g., "PascalCase with 'I' prefix"]
- **Constants**: [Convention, e.g., "UPPER_SNAKE_CASE"]
- **Private Members**: [Convention, e.g., "camelCase with underscore prefix"]

### File Organization

- **Directory Structure**: [Convention, e.g., "Feature-based organization"]
- **File Naming**: [Convention, e.g., "kebab-case for files"]
- **Code Grouping**: [Convention, e.g., "Related functionality in the same directory"]

### Coding Practices

- **Indentation**: [Convention, e.g., "2 spaces"]
- **Maximum Line Length**: [Convention, e.g., "80 characters"]
- **Comments**: [Convention, e.g., "JSDoc style for functions"]
- **Error Handling**: [Convention, e.g., "Use custom error classes"]
- **Asynchronous Code**: [Convention, e.g., "Async/await over Promises"]
