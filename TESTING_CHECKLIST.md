# Testing Checklist

This document outlines comprehensive testing procedures for each phase of the refactoring process. It ensures that all critical functionality is verified and any regressions are caught early.

## General Testing Guidelines

1. **Test Early and Often**: Run appropriate tests after each significant change
2. **Automated First**: Prioritize automated testing over manual testing where possible
3. **Regression Prevention**: Always run regression tests to ensure existing functionality is maintained
4. **Test in Isolation**: Test refactored components in isolation before integration testing
5. **Documentation**: Document all test results, especially failures and their resolutions

## Pre-Refactoring Baseline

Before beginning any refactoring work, establish a baseline by performing the following tests:

- [ ] Run all existing unit tests
- [ ] Run all existing integration tests
- [ ] Perform end-to-end testing of critical user flows
- [ ] Measure and record performance metrics
- [ ] Document known issues and technical debt

**Baseline Metrics to Record**:
- Test coverage percentage: _____%
- Number of passing tests: _____
- Number of failing tests: _____
- Critical path response times: _____ ms
- Build time: _____ minutes
- Memory usage: _____ MB
- CPU usage under load: _____%

## Phase 1: [Analysis & Planning] Testing

- [ ] Verify test environment setup

## Phase 2: [Initial Refactoring] Testing

### Unit Tests

- [ ] Run unit tests for refactored components
- [ ] Verify test coverage meets or exceeds baseline

- [ ] Ensure tests are isolated and don't depend on external state

### Component-Level Tests

## Phase 4: [System Integration] Testing

### End-to-End Tests

- [ ] Test critical user flows

- [ ] Verify audit logging

## Phase 5: [Pre-Deployment] Testing

### Regression Tests

- [ ] Run full test suite
